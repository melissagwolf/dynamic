# dynamic

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dynamic is to simulate fit index cutoffs for latent variable
models that are tailored to the userâ€™s model statement, model type, and
sample size.

This is the counterpart of the Shiny Application,
<a href="https://dynamicfit.app/connect/"
target="_parent">dynamicfit.app</a>. The Shiny app and the R package
will give you the same results. If you are comfortable with R, consider
using the package during high traffic times to reduce server burden.

## Installation

This is the beta version of the package. Please submit bug reports and
issues on GitHub. You can install the released version of dynamic from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

`install.packages("dynamic")`

**Currently, the functions for categorical data (`catOne` and `catHB`)
and for non-normal continuous data (`nnorOne` and `nnorHB`) are only
available from the GitHub package and are not yet available on CRAN or
the Shiny application.**

To install the version of the package that supports these functions,
use:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("melissagwolf/dynamic")
```

## Example

``` r
library(dynamic)

#Lavaan object example (manual=FALSE)
dat <- lavaan::HolzingerSwineford1939
lavmod <- "F1 =~ x1 + x2 + x3
          F2 =~ x4 + x5 + x6
          F3 =~ x7 + x8 + x9"
fit <- lavaan::cfa(lavmod,dat)
cfaHB(fit)

#Manual entry example (manual=TRUE)
manmod <- "F1 =~ .602*Y1 + .805*Y2 + .857*Y3 + .631*Y4 + .345*Y5 + .646*Y6"
cfaOne(manmod,500,manual=TRUE)
```
